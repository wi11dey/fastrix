# Fast Matrix Multiplication for C

Minimal (<500 SLOC), mathematically accurate, low memory-footprint implmentation of fast matrix multiplication (using [Strassen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm#Asymptotic_complexity)) in ANSI C99 for embedded systems.

Executable includes built-in test suite.
